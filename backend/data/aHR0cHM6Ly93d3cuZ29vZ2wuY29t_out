One critical loophole in the terms and conditions is that all amounts paid are non-refundable, except for certain refund requests that may be considered on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of AgileBits, Inc. This means that if you are not satisfied with the service, you may not be able to get a refund unless AgileBits, Inc. decides to grant it. It is important to be aware of this before subscribing to the service.
