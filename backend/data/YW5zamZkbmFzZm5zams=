Purdue University

Indian, USA

Research Intern
May 2019 ‑ July 2019
• Worked on the development of a ”Digital twin” of the laboratory for the remote operation of different robots
– Integrated Kuka, Doosan and a CNC machine on ROS for seamless relay of information across them and synchronising their movements
– Integrated models of the robots onto a virtual environment in Unity using MTConnect (open sourced software for digital factories)
– Interconnected Haptic device ‑ Phantom Omni, capable of digitalizing human movements with KUKA and DOOSAN robots using ROS
• Created a virtual environment in Unity where we could control the virtual robot for replication of movement in the real world
• Tele‑operation model designed to be used as a digital twin of factories and for virtual labs helping people to perform experiments remotely

University Projects

Smart Metrology, Thesis Project

Illinois, USA

University of Illinois, Urbana‑Champaign
Aug 2023 ‑ Present
• Developed a Smart Pattern Matching system for Dimension Measurement by parsing CAD information ‑ dimensions, tolarecnes etc.
• Executed measurement of tolerances, encompassing both geometric and dimensional aspects, and verified them against CAD models.

Obstacle Avoidance with Segway ‑ Controls

Illinois, USA

University of Illinois, Urbana‑Champaign
Aug 2023 ‑ Dec 2023
• Implemented controls for a Segway with IR sensors in C using Texas Instrument C2000 micro‑controller to detect and avoid obstacles
• State Space approach by having different operation modes ‑ Navigation mode, Wall following mode to follow the obstacle and then back to
Navigation mode after avoiding the obstacle ‑ https://www.hackster.io/513149/obstacle‑avoidance‑and‑human‑following‑segway‑6836c6

Toonification ‑ Computer Vision
