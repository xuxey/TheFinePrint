One critical loophole in the terms and conditions is that all amounts paid are non-refundable, except for certain refund requests that may be considered on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of AgileBits, Inc. This means that users may not be able to get a refund for their subscription fees in most cases. It is important for clients to be aware of this non-refundable policy before agreeing to the terms and conditions.
