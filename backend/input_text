Computer Vision
To extract “meaning” from pixels

person, motorcycle, car, chair

Meaning can take different
forms:
• Geometric Inferences
• Semantic Inferences
• Inferences about actions
• …

Computer vision is easy for humans
• Effortlessly analyze
images for a variety of
tasks
• Infer semantics even from
severely ablated input
• Can also make precise
inference about certain
geometric properties

Yet has proven very hard for computers
• Computer vision research
easily goes back 60 years …

• Entirely true as of 2014 (or so)
when this xkcd was published

Why is computer vision hard?
• Images are a lossy projection of the world
3D world

Point of observation

Geometry information is lost

Why is computer vision hard?
• Images are a lossy projection of the world
What color is the dress?
A) Black and blue
B) White and gold?

Appearance
information is
also lost

Why is computer vision hard?
• Images are a lossy projection of the world

Might cause
objects to blend

Why is computer vision hard?
• Images are a lossy projection of the world (geometry, appearance, …
are lost)
• Visual world is diverse

Viewpoint variation

Shape variation

Why is computer vision hard?
• Images are a lossy projection of the world (geometry, appearance, …
are lost)
• Visual world is diverse

Background clutter

Occlusion

Why is computer vision hard?
• Images are a lossy projection of
the world (geometry,
appearance, … are lost)
• need some priors to interpret
what you are seeing
• Visual world is diverse
• can’t write down these priors
by hand

Origins of computer vision

Six decades of computer vision
1960s: Beginnings in artificial intelligence, image processing and pattern
recognition
1970s: Foundational work on image formation: Horn, Koenderink, LonguetHiggins …
1980s: Vision as applied mathematics: geometry, multi-scale analysis,
probabilistic modeling, control theory, optimization
1990s: Geometric analysis largely completed, vision meets graphics, statistical
learning approaches resurface
2000s: Significant advances in visual recognition
2010s: Progress continues, aided by the availability of large amounts of visual
data and massive computing power. Deep learning has become pre-eminent
